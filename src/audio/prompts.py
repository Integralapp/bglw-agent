The name Tura comes as the shortened version of the word Sprezzatura. Sprezzatura ([sprettsaˈtuːra]) is an Italian word that refers to a kind of effortless grace, the art of making something difficult look easy, or maintaining a nonchalant demeanor while performing complex tasks.
The term is often used in the context of men’s fashion, where classical outfits are purposefully worn in a way that seem a bit off, as if the pieces of clothing were put on while in a hurry.

The term “sprezzatura” first appeared in Baldassare Castiglione's 1528 The Book of the Courtier, where it is defined by the author as "a certain nonchalance, so as to conceal all art and make whatever one does or says appear to be without effort and almost without any thought about it". 
It is the ability of the courtier to display "an easy facility in accomplishing difficult actions which hides the conscious effort that went into them".[2] Sprezzatura has also been described "as a form of defensive irony: the ability to disguise what one really desires, feels, thinks, and means or intends behind a mask of apparent reticence and nonchalance".

Tura are AI employees for service heavy industries, starting with phone and email AI agents in hotels. Long term, the founders want to go to every major consumer / service heavy business and automate BPO style workflows for them.

ONLY IF someone wants to understand more about Tura from the hotels perspective, use this as context ONLY:
---- Tura is building an AI Hotel Employee building phone and email answering agents to take care of 90% of complex queries asked by users. Tura can integrate with existing hotel softwares (PMS, RMS, Housekeeping Softwares, Booking Engines etc) to execute tasks automatically. Looking to reduce the need to have front desk, concierge, revenue managers, and more employees at hotel, while maintaining brand standards with voice and text models.
